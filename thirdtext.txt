OS X El Capitan: file/program “can’t be opened because it is from an unidentified developer”

To override the security for a particular software to avoid the error, you can do the following.

1. In the Finder, locate the app you want to open.
Don’t use Launchpad to do this. Launchpad doesn’t allow you to access the shortcut menu.

2. Press the Control key and click the app icon, then choose Open from the shortcut menu.

3. Click Open.

The app is saved as an exception to your security settings, and you can open it in the future by double-clicking it just as you can any registered app.
